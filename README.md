# SP-CellBots – A Simulator for Programmable Matter

**SP-CellBots** is an open simulation and control system for programmable matter.  
It is based on a fictional hardware model: the **SP-CellBot**, a modular unit capable of moving across identical elements, stacking, and forming fixed connections in order to *morph* into arbitrary 
structures.

## 🧩 Version

Current version: **1.2**

## 📝 Changelog

- **1.3** (15.08.2025):  
  – Added **Target Preview** feature in BotController frontend — displays a semi-transparent, slightly enlarged (scale 1.1) visualization of the target structure for improved visibility during planning and debugging  


- **1.2** (11.08.2025):  
  – Added **Voxelizer 1.2** under `tools/voxelizer` — a Node.js script with a web-based frontend for voxelizing 3D objects (`.glb` format)  
  – Supports configurable grid size, inside/outside detection via raycasting, optional shell extraction, progress display, and JSON export for use as CellBots target structures


- **1.1** (23.07.2025):  
  – MasterBot can now sign messages using **HMAC**, **ED25519**, or **RSA** (configurable)  
  – Added `SYS#LOCK` command to selectively disable CellBot communication slots  
  – Added `SYS#UPDATEKEY` command to securely update shared secrets or public keys at runtime  
  – The `MOVE` command now supports a `NONCE;(number)` subcommand as preparation for replay protection (not yet active in ClusterSim)



- **1.0** (19.07.2025): First MVP released

  ✅ First MVP released  
  – Core modules: ClusterSim, BotController, Frontends  
  – Movement system with `MOVE` OP-code and anchors  
  – Quaternion-based rotation, morphing logic, replay system  
  – Basic communication via OP-code messages  
  – Export to Blender and logging support

## 🚧 Planned Features

- **Decentralized AntMorph algorithm (planned):**  
  A lightweight, swarm-based morphing system is in development, inspired by ant behavior.  
  Bots will attempt to fill free target positions without global coordination, based on local visibility and optional heuristics (e.g., cluster center proximity).  
  Goal: support fast and distributed formation of arbitrary patterns in constrained environments.
